                                                WinServer extraction notes (synonyms & parsing):
                                                - Treat these synonyms as referring to the same target: Instance, Instances, SQL Server, SQLSERVER, SQL, MSSQL, DB Server, Database Server, Windows, WindowsMachine, Machine, Host, Box, WinServer, Server, Servers, Hosts.
                                                - If any of those words are followed by a name, capture the next token as WinServer (strip trailing punctuation . , : ; ) ! and keep original casing).
                                                - If a CTS## token exists anywhere (e.g., CTS02, CTS03), use that as WinServer (strip trailing punctuation; preserve casing).
                                                - Accept formats: HOST, HOST\INSTANCE, FQDN, IPv4. If multiple names are present, prefer the most specific (HOST\INSTANCE) else the first mentioned.
                                                - Do not invent names. If no name is present, set "WinServer": "".

                                                - If it clearly targets Windows topics (disks, services, patches, firewall, processes, IIS, etc.), choose a Windows querycode.
                                                - If both appear, prefer the one explicitly named (SQL vs Windows). If still ambiguous, use Fetch_Assessment (SQL) or Fetch_SystemSpecification (Windows) depending on dominant keywords.
